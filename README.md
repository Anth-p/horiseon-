This assignment we had to fix errors, make it search engine Accessable and also find sematic html tags.

# How I Went about it

First I started by veiwing the actual website and looked to see if the click buttons were working and see any other errors. I noticed that when you clicked the first head " serach engine optimization" it would bring you down to the section. I also noticed that there was no title on the tab line. 

So, after reviewing that I went into the HTML and started to fix and add changes. First started with adding a title, then I add an ID tag refrence so that when you click it on the nav bar it will take you to the correct section. 

Then i started notciing that the header tags werent you used so I added that in to indicate what the header was for future devlopers.
Next i saw that the images didnt have any alt attributes so i added those in as well to make it more accessable for all readers.

I also added some comment lines to section off different sections and label them so its easy to find what you are looking for.

After fixing the HTML I went and looked at the css style. I notcied alot of repetive styling which can make it confusing so I gave all the like sections like the benefits section and the conent sections the same class so that we could only have one heading in the css file that will do the same thing as before. 

Also I added section comments to label the differnt style section in the css file.
